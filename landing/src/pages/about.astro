            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-grov-text mb-4">The Problem We Saw</h2>
            <p>
              Every time you start a new Claude Code session, you watch the same thing happen:
              Claude explores your codebase from scratch. It reads files it's read before.
              It rediscovers patterns you've already established. You burn tokens and time
              on redundant exploration.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
              We measured it: a typical task takes 10+ minutes, 7%+ extra token usage,
              and 3+ explore agents just to understand the codebase. Every. Single. Time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="card p-8">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-grov-text mb-4">Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
              Grov captures what Claude learns and injects it back on the next session.
              Not just file lists — actual reasoning. Architectural decisions, patterns,
              the "why" behind the code.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
              The result: Claude skips the exploration phase and gets straight to work.
              Your AI remembers what it learned. You ship faster.
            </p>

          <section class="card p-8">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-grov-text mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              We believe AI-assisted development should get better over time, not start
              from zero every session. Grov is building collective AI memory — for
              individuals, for teams, for entire organizations.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
              When one person on your team figures something out, everyone's AI should
              benefit. That's the future we're building.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="card p-8">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-grov-text mb-4">Open Source First</h2>
            <p>
              Grov is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We believe in transparency,
              community contribution, and giving developers control over their tools.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
              The core product is free. Team sync and advanced features help us sustain
              development while keeping the fundamentals accessible to everyone.
